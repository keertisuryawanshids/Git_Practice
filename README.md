# Git_Practice

Git Practice Repository
Project Overview
This repository is designed for practicing Git workflows and version control with Jupyter notebooks. The repository includes various machine learning models and projects related to weather prediction, PV production analysis, and other data-driven insights.

Notebooks Included
lstm_For_All_Buildings.ipynb: This notebook implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predicting PV production across multiple buildings based on weather data. The model captures temporal dependencies in the dataset to improve accuracy.

Dept_1_2_GBR.ipynb: This notebook showcases a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model for predicting energy production for specific departments. The focus is on optimizing model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

Features
Time-series modeling using LSTM and GBR for energy and weather data prediction.
Real-time data analysis with accurate insights.
Interactive visualizations to explain model performance.
